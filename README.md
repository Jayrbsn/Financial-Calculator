# Financial-Calculator

## Project Details

### Description:
For this task, I was told to assume that I had been approached by a small financial company and asked to create a program that would allow a user to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.

### Functionality:
From the main menu the user is given an option to choose which calculation they would like done. How the user capitalises their selection was not to affect how the
program proceeds. However, if the user did not enter a valid input an appropriate error message was to be shown.

If the user selects 'investment', they are prompted to provide the initial deposit amount, interest rate and investment horizon. They are then given an option between calculating returns based on compound or simple interest.

If the user selects 'bond' to calculate a home loan repayment, they are prompted to provide the value of the house, the interest rate and the number of months over which they would likely be paying back this loan.

###Usefulness:
This Python project is useful because it will enable financial professionals to make difficult calculations quickly and accurately. It could also be added to the website of a financial planning business, for example, where it could be used as a free resource which would drive more traffic to that businesses website and also add to their credibility.
